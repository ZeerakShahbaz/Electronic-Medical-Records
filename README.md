# Health Information System for Electronic Medical Records

## Overview
This project involves building a Health Information System for managing Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) to enhance Canada's healthcare system. It involves creating a scalable, flexible, and efficient back-end system, designed to handle large volumes of data.

## Features
The Health Information System provides the following features:
1. Reading patient data from a plaintext file.
2. Displaying statistics about patients (average vital signs, specific patient data).
3. Displaying patient data for all patients or specific patients by ID.
4. Adding new patient data to the patient list.
5. Finding patient visits in a certain month or year.
6. Identifying patients who need follow-ups based on their vital statistics.
7. A text-based interface for user interaction.

## Dataset
The dataset, `patients.txt`, is structured in a comma-separated format with each new record on a new line.

## Learning Outcomes
This project provided practice with the following:
- Breaking tasks into manageable parts using functions.
- Implementing complex data structures like dictionaries and lists.
- Text processing for reading and writing patient data.
- Handling exceptions in Python code.
- Using Python modules to improve code efficiency and readability.
- Developing and testing programs according to given specifications.

## System Interface
The text-based interface provides the following options:
1. Display all patient data
2. Display patient data by ID
3. Add patient data
4. Display patient statistics
5. Find visits by year, month, or both
6. Find patients who need follow-ups
7. Delete all visits of a particular patient
8. Quit
